The app will be mainly used for caretakers(carer, children of the elderly) to monitor elderly while they are distant from elderly due to their work or duty. The users or the caretakers are asked to sign up to use the app. They can simply sign up through Google or any corresponding social media accounts to sign up.

It alerts when elderly leaves home. The caretakers can have four options, which are:
1. Make a call to the Dr.Watch so that the elderly can answer the call
2. Dismiss the ringing alarm (allow the elderly to leave home)
3. Send notification to Dr.Watch. The watch will vibrate when notification is sent.
4. Track closely. This allows the caretakers to observe the location of the elderly.
